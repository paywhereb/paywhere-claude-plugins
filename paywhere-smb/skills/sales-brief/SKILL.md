Run the sales analysis and content brief. Pull what sold (and what didn't), explain why, and produce a ready-to-use content plan that acts on the data.

Parse arguments:
- `--lookback` (default: `30d`) — `30d`, `60d`, or `90d` lookback window

## Step 1 — Sales breakdown

Using the `content-strategy` skill workflow for sales analysis:

1. Pull QuickBooks invoice line items for the lookback period grouped by product/service/SKU.
2. Sum revenue by product/service category and compute unit volume + margin (where COGS is available in QB).
3. Rank products by total revenue, unit volume, and margin.
4. Calculate each product's share of total revenue vs. prior equivalent period.

Top sellers: products that grew share or maintained top-3 rank.
Bottom sellers: products with declining volume or below 5% of revenue.

## Step 2 — Seasonality check

1. Compare current period to same period in prior year (if QB history available).
2. Flag any items with a seasonal pattern (e.g., spikes in Q4, slow summers).
3. Note any new products with insufficient history to detect seasonality.

## Step 3 — Why analysis

For each top and bottom seller, explain the likely driver:
- Price change, promo, new channel, seasonal demand, competitor move
- Cross-reference with HubSpot campaign activity for the period
- Note where attribution is inferred vs. confirmed

## Step 4 — 2-week content brief

Produce a ready-to-use content brief:

```
2-Week Content Brief — {date range}

PUSH THESE (winners)
• {product}: {suggested angle} — {channel: email|social|both}
• {product}: {suggested angle} — {channel}

CLEAR THESE (slow movers)
• {product}: {promo angle or bundle suggestion} — {channel}

CONTENT CALENDAR
Week 1:
  Mon: {post/email concept}
  Wed: {post/email concept}
  Fri: {post/email concept}
Week 2:
  Mon: {post/email concept}
  Wed: {post/email concept}
  Fri: {post/email concept}
```

## Connector failures

If QuickBooks is unreachable, stop — sales analysis requires product-level revenue data and QuickBooks is the canonical source. Offer the owner a CSV upload path (sales by product, last 90 days) if they don't want to reconnect QB right now. If HubSpot is missing, skip campaign cross-reference in the "why analysis" and note it.

## Approval gates

- **Never auto-schedule or publish content.** The brief is for owner review only.
- **Never create Canva assets automatically** — offer to generate them after owner approves the brief.

## Output

Present the sales analysis, then the content brief. Ask the owner if they'd like to generate Canva assets for any of the planned posts.
