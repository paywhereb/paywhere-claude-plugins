# Onboard checklist

## The five interview questions

Ask one at a time. Wait for the full answer before moving on. One follow-up is fine if an answer is vague; do not drill further.

1. **Industry and business type.** "What kind of business do you run? Give me the one-liner."
2. **Team size.** "How many people work with you, including yourself?"
3. **Top three headaches.** "What are your three biggest headaches right now — the things that eat your time or keep you up at night?"
4. **Tools already in use.** "Which tools do you already use day-to-day? Things like QuickBooks, Paywhere, Gmail, Google Drive…"
5. **Preferred cadence.** "How would you like me to check in — daily, weekly, or only when you ask?"

If the owner is short on time, compress to questions 1, 3, and 4 — those three feed the most downstream skills.

## Connector priority matrix

Map the owner's stated headache to the best two connectors to link first.

| Primary headache | First connector | Second connector | Prove-value recipe |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cash flow / invoicing | Paywhere | QuickBooks | `cash-flow-snapshot` |
| Making payroll | Paywhere | QuickBooks | `plan-payroll` |
| Month-end close / reconciliation | QuickBooks | Paywhere | `close-month` |
| Paying reps / commissions | Paywhere | QuickBooks | `pay-commissions` (needs Google Drive too) |
| Taxes | QuickBooks | Paywhere | `tax-prep` |
| Chasing unpaid invoices | QuickBooks | Gmail | `invoice-chase` |
| General / unsure | Paywhere | QuickBooks | `cash-flow-snapshot` |

If the owner names a connector not in this table, add it as the second connector and use `business-pulse` as the recipe.

**Connector capability blurbs (one short sentence each, used when introducing a connector to the owner):**

- **Paywhere** — Pull your cash position across accounts, see settled ACH/wire/stablecoin movement in real time, and make payments without leaving chat.
- **QuickBooks** — Read your books: AR, AP, P&L, customer payments, and the transaction register that month-end close reconciles against Paywhere.
- **Gmail** — Draft invoice reminders and scan threads for anything urgent.
- **Google Drive** — Host the commission register and save close packets and QBR exports.

## Recipe selection

Run the prove-value recipe immediately after the **first** connector is live — do not wait for the second. If connectors are already active at session start, run the matched recipe for the owner's primary headache before beginning the interview. Priority order:

1. Paywhere or QuickBooks → `cash-flow-snapshot`
2. QuickBooks + Paywhere → `business-pulse` (one-page financial snapshot)
3. Gmail → search for unread invoice-related emails, surface top 3
4. Google Drive only → confirm Drive is readable (`list_recent_files`) — it powers `/pay-and-bill` hour-report notes and close-packet exports

**QuickBooks profile_info_required:** If QuickBooks returns a `profile_info_required` status (missing business_name or industry), use the `quickbooks-profile-info-update` tool with the owner's business name from interview question 1 before running `cash-flow-snapshot`. Do not skip the recipe — collect the missing info first. On the shared **read-only demo connector** that update tool does not exist — note the missing profile info and run the recipe anyway; the seeded demo company is already complete.

## Owner profile — storage format

Write this block to the Cowork session memory directory under the heading `## Business context`. Every other skill reads this section by heading match. Do not rename the heading or change the field names.

```markdown
## Business context

- **Business:** <one-liner — industry, product/service>
- **Size:** <number of people, including owner>
- **Top headaches:** <headache 1> · <headache 2> · <headache 3>
- **Connected tools:** <comma-separated list of active connectors>
- **Weekly cadence:** <trigger phrase and day, e.g. "weekly check-in every Monday">
- **Onboarded:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

If a memory file already exists, append or update only the `## Business context` section. Do not touch other content.
